        <h2>What is this site about?</h2>
        <p><em>Who said eating healthy can't be fun?</em><br>First of all, let me start by saying that <strong>there are no "bad" and "good" foods</strong>. There are just foods with more calories and foods with less calories. Everything depends on whether you are trying to lose weight or you are trying to gain weight. And believe me I'm not here to judge you if you are craving for a Snikers or a Coke. I'm just here to give you an idea of what you might cook yourself so that you can be in line with your regime.<br>On this website you will find recipes for <em>main dishes, side dishes, desserts</em> and so on. Each recipe will have it's macros calculated, a price for cooking this meal (the price might vary depending on price changes on the market!) and also a suggestion where you can find these products the cheapest. That way you can easily calculate not only your macros, but also your food finances and you will certainly get a better understanding of what food you are consuming. Of course, you can always change a recipe to your liking. Feel free to experiment, to change and to share after that so you can inspire others to try it!</p>
        <p><strong>Important things you should know about me:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm always hungry...</li>
            <li>I have a love/hate relationship with the salt - I tend to put too much or not at all. I rarely put the right amount...</li>
            <li>I don't use sugar but sweeteners.</li>
            <li>Desserts are my soft spot and most of the recipes here are from this category</li>
